# TO-DO

Features I'd like to add to this project:

- Add "Game Over!" text on the center of the screen once the player loses;
- Add an FPS and size/score counter in the top-left corner of the screen;

Mistakes to fix:

- When changing resolution (width and height) to a number different than 640, it leads to unexpected behaviour.
